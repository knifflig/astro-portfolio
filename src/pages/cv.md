description:
  I’m a political scientist by training. As a keen observer of socio-political trends, I have a passion for bridging the gap between analytical methods and human behavior. I’m primarily familiar with R and Python, but have also done numerous smaller projects in other languages and am always interested in learning new ones.

I mainly worked with [#R](/tags/r "R") and [#python](/tags/python "Python") for machine learning, but also have done some web development with [#alpine](/tags/alpine "alpine") / [#react](/tags/react "react") components with [#tailwindcss](/tags/tailwindcss "tailwindcss") in [#javascript](/tags/javascript "javascript") / [#typescript](/tags/typescript "typescript").

## Interests & Skills

I am deeply interested in exploring the intricate layers of [#society](/tags/society "society"), understanding [#perceptions](/tags/perceptions "perceptions") of inequality between different social groups, and delving into the narratives behind human [#behaviour](/tags/behaviour "behaviour"). My work focuses on the complexities of social identities, the influence of political communication on social discourse, and the stories told through individual behaviour, particularly in the face of environmental stimuli. These interests underpin my commitment to developing informed strategies that resonate with diverse audiences.

Using advanced techniques such as [#content](/tags/content "content") analysis, I enjoy exploring dimensions of social stratification to inform policy development and communication strategies. I specialize in [#causal](/tags/causal "causal") inference, delving deep into the "why" behind observable social and political phenomena. I am also committed to well done data vizualisation and [#development](/tags/development "development") of tools and applications that make statistical analysis accessible, providing intuitive interfaces for complex computations.


If you are more interested, you can find contributions and case studies on my [#interests](/tags/interests "interests") and [#skills](/tags/skills "skills") following the associated tags.

## Education

### *Okt 2021 -- Sep 2023*

#### Master (M.A.) Political Science @LMU Munich

*Thesis: Representation in turbulent times - Drivers of responsiveness to young voters (graded 1,0)*

The master’s program included advanced courses in EU politics, po- litical representation, and assessed populist politics. Topics include identity-driven populism in Germany, role models in politics, and Eu- ropean integration. I used advanced causal inference methods such as difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity design, and synthetic control methods in single unit studies. Master’s thesis focuses on the representation and responsiveness of young voters using sub- group analysis of survey/panel data and two-way fixed effects models.

### *Okt 2018 -- Sep 2021*

#### Bachelor (B.A.) Political Science @LMU Munich

*Thesis: Protest mobilisation in context - Studies on the structural causes of protests (graded 1,7)*

Focused on the challenges of democracy, public policy, and surveys in political science. Key coursework included the study of climate change skepticism, social welfare, and economic inequality. Utilized methods such as multinomial logit regression and linear regression.

## Working Experiences

### *2014 - 2016*

#### Business Development Assistant @PRÜFTECHNIK Group

Worked as part of a small team on a variety of topics, including risk and market analysis and setting up sales structures in the U.S.

### *2022-2023*

#### Personal assistant of Prof. Dr. Lukas Rudolph @LMU & @University of Konstanz

Assisted Prof. Rudolph on several projects, most notably a project examining the public as a driver or barrier to ambitious climate policy, an examination of the determinants of vaccination rates in Bangladesh, and several projects working with causal experimental survey designs.

## Other Experiences

### *Jul 2023*

#### Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science ([SICSS](https://sicss.io/2023/munich/ "SICSS"))

Participated in an intensive program focused on equipping social scientists with computational skills. Gain hands-on experience with machine learning, data scraping, and statistical modeling techniques. Worked on collaborative projects that applied these skills to real-world social science problems, such as public opinion analysis.

### *2013 -- 2018*

#### Lots of Work and lots of travel

The foundation of my current understanding of society.

## Life Choices

Living in Munich has provided me with a rich academic and cultural background, but I have ambitions to direct my future professional endeavors to Berlin. I have a keen interest in coffee, both as a hobby and almost as an art form; I dabble in making coffee with specialized equipment and even participate in hobby competitions. My wanderlust takes me far and wide - I love exploring different countries and cultures, often combining these travels with my passion for cycling. This makes me versatile, adaptable and always eager to learn and experience new things.
