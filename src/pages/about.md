description:
  I’m a political scientist by training. As a keen observer of socio-political trends, I have a passion for bridging the gap between analytical methods and human behavior. I’m primarily familiar with R and Python, but have also done numerous smaller projects in other languages and am always interested in learning new ones.

## Phrases you might hear

- **"Who does what and why"** | Using advanced techniques such as content analysis, I enjoy making evidence-based decisions when solving problems. I particularly enjoy econometric methods such as causal inference, which explores the 'why' behind observable phenomena.

- **"Ink per information"** | I am passionate about well-designed data visualisation and the development of tools and applications that make statistical analysis accessible by providing intuitive interfaces to complex computations.

- **"Stay lean"** | My approach to problems tends to be inherently structured; you'll often find me sketching out mind maps or workflow diagrams to visualise the challenge at hand. This helps me find lean processes no matter what the problem on the stack, and I really enjoy finding smart alternatives to cumbersome approaches.

- **"Sharing is caring"** | I'm at my best when I'm working with people who share their knowledge. People who, like me, are always curious to explore new frontiers. In our fast-paced digital age, the ability to collaborate in real time is a boon. Working not only in shared documents but also in digital workspaces (Github + Scrum ❤️) is definitely a green flag.

## Tech Stack

I mainly worked with [#R](/tags/r "R") and [#python](/tags/python "Python") for machine learning, but also have done some web development with [#alpine](/tags/alpine "alpine") / [#react](/tags/react "react") components with [#tailwindcss](/tags/tailwindcss "tailwindcss") in [#javascript](/tags/javascript "javascript") / [#typescript](/tags/typescript "typescript"). For larger data storage i usually use [#mysql](/tags/mysql "mysql").

## Interests

I am deeply interested in exploring the intricate layers of society, understanding perceptions of inequality between different social groups, and delving into the narratives behind human behaviour. My work focuses on the complexities of social identities, the influence of political communication on social discourse, and the stories told through individual behaviour, particularly in the face of environmental stimuli. These interests underpin my commitment to developing informed strategies that resonate with diverse audiences.

## Life Choices

Living in Munich has provided me with a rich academic and cultural background, but I have ambitions to direct my future professional endeavors to Berlin. I have a keen interest in coffee, both as a hobby and almost as an art form; I dabble in making coffee with specialized equipment and even participate in hobby competitions. My wanderlust takes me far and wide - I love exploring different countries and cultures, often combining these travels with my passion for cycling. This makes me versatile, adaptable and always eager to learn and experience new things.
