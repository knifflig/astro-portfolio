## Hello Everyone

<div class="flex flex-row items-start w-full p-0 mt-12">

    <p class="mt-2">I‚Äôm a political scientist by training. As a keen observer of society, I have a passion for bridging the gap between analytical methods and humans. I‚Äôm primarily familiar with R and Python, but have also done numerous smaller projects with other languages and frameworks and am always interested in learning new ones.</p>

Balancing multiple small and large projects has been a constant endeavour, fuelled by this insatiable curiosity. Each project brings its own set of challenges and rewards, and it's the story behind these experiences that I'm keen to share. Of course, I'm equally keen to hear your perspectives and insights; after all, a conversation is most enriching when it's a two-way street. While Twitter was a haven for such interactions, its unfortunate demise took that away. But as the saying goes, when one door closes, a window - or maybe even another door - opens. This blog aims to be that new vessel for a more nuanced and fulfilling discourse. Expect regular posts about various projects I'm working on, as well as ruminations on topics that pique my interest, and hopefully yours. For those who prefer other platforms, I'll also be posting updates on Mastodon and possibly Reddit.

## ‚ùì Why I Write

From political science research to the intricacies of data visualisation and the art of coffee making, I have a wide range of interests. My fascination with social science can be traced back to a simple yet profound question posed by my history teacher:

> Who does what and why?

This phrase, simple in its construction but deep in its implications, has haunted me ever since. It has slowly but surely shaped my curiosity into what it is today. You see, these questions are more than just words to me. They've become a lens through which I examine the intricate dynamics of human behaviour and societal norms. At the heart of it all is the compelling challenge of understanding how individuals and societies define themselves, make sense of their surroundings and choose a course of action in an increasingly complex world.

As we move forward, I can't help but feel that unlocking these dynamics is one of the most pressing tasks of the coming years. And guess what? We're going to tackle it right here, one contribution at a time. So whether you're a fellow scientist, an armchair philosopher, or simply someone fascinated by the way our world works, I invite you to share your insights, challenge assumptions, and join me in this exploration. Because when it comes to understanding the who, the what and the why, every perspective counts.

## üíª A Data-Driven Approach

As we continue to explore the fascinating landscape of political science and social behaviour, it's impossible to overlook the powerful role that technology plays in our understanding. The digital age has not only connected us in unprecedented ways, it has also given us incredible access to data - so much so that we're practically swimming in it. But here's the conundrum: the availability of data often outpaces our ability to understand it. Every tweet, Instagram post or TikTok video is a breadcrumb trail of human behaviour. But how do we make sense of all those bits and bytes? That's where computational techniques come in. By applying structured analysis to textual, visual and audio content, we can gain valuable insights into society. These aren't just numbers and graphs; they're windows into the collective psyche of our communities, offering us ways to understand our motivations, fears and aspirations.

Why is this important? Looking at correlations alone can sometimes lead us to believe that certain factors are related when they aren't. For an insightful take on this, check out the [Spurious Correlations blog](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations "spurious blog"). It highlights studies with statistically significant but completely nonsensical associations. One amusing example is a correlation between per capita cheese consumption and the number of deaths caused by entanglement in bedsheets:

  </div>

If you're curious about how data science fits into the social sciences, or if you have experience or thoughts on the effectiveness of computational techniques, I'd love to hear from you. After all, as we all know, the more angles from which we can look, the clearer the picture becomes.

## üìà The Art of Data Visualization

As we navigate the maze of data, analysis and insight, there's one aspect that deserves its own spotlight: data visualisation. The adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" is surprisingly true when it comes to complex data sets and intricate analysis.

My own journey into creating charts and graphs began as a necessity, but quickly became something more. After immersing myself in the thought-provoking works of Edward Tufte, I've developed a real affinity for well-crafted data visualisation. It's an area where aesthetics meets functionality, and when it's done right, the result is nothing short of mesmerising. But let's not gloss over the challenges. Creating a graph that is both informative and uncluttered is a balancing act. Yet there's an indescribable beauty in achieving that balance, in creating a visual narrative that speaks clearly yet carries layers of information.

  <div class="flex p-2 w-full">

  </div>
</div>

A good example for this is a map created by [Charles Joseph Minard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Minard "Charles Joseph Minard") in 1869. The depiction of Napoleon's major setbacks in the Russian campaign of 1812 is often hailed as a [masterpiece](https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003mn "Tufte Minard") of statistical visualisation. It effectively communicates six different types of data in a two-dimensional layout. While such a depth of information is rarely necessary in a single graph, it serves as a compelling example of how visual storytelling can be both concise and comprehensive.

For those intrigued by this intersection of art and science, you're in for a treat. From time to time, I'll be sharing and dissecting visualisations - both those I've created and others that catch my eye. Whether you're a seasoned data viz enthusiast or someone just starting to appreciate its complexities, your perspectives will only enrich this fascinating dialogue.

## ‚òï A Brew-tiful Journey

While we delve into the depths of political science, data analysis and social patterns, let's take a moment to venture into a different but equally fascinating world - the sublime art of making and enjoying espresso. Although seemingly disparate, there are striking parallels between my other interests and my love of coffee. Both are fields where process and outcome are deeply intertwined, and a nuanced understanding of the variables can make all the difference. Whether it's a socio-political trend or a shot of espresso, dissecting the drivers behind the results is both a science and an art. Whether it's adjusting the grind size or tweaking a Python script, the devil really is in the details. My own introduction to espresso was a happy accident. It started with an old, broken Rancilio Silvia. "How hard could it be to fix?" I wondered. As it turned out, not too hard. Using the Raspberry Pi to build my own PID temperature controller was not only functional, it was almost free. And just like that, a new, albeit expensive, hobby was born.

My coffee journey has come a long way since then. I currently have an ECM Synchronica coupled with a Eureka Mignon Specialita, and I'm eagerly awaiting delivery of my [Timemore Sculpture 078S grinder](https://www.timemore.com.au/products/sculptor-078s-electric-coffee-grinder-espresso-filter "T 078S"). As for coffee beans, my current favourite is the GUAVA BANANA from [Pacande Coffee](https://pacande.com "Pacande Coffee") in Munich. For fellow coffee lovers or curious beginners, keep an eye out for posts about new equipment, beans and coffee spots I come across. Whether you're a connoisseur or just someone who enjoys a good cup, I'd love to hear your thoughts and recommendations.

So here's to the simple yet profound pleasures in life‚Äîmay our cups and minds always be full.

Keep up and stay tuned. üêú
