For those managing collaborative projects, especially in the IT sector, SCRUM is often the framework of choice due to its flexibility, adaptability and ability to make progress iteratively. The entry level certification in SCRUM is the Professional Scrum Master I ([PSM I](https://www.credly.com/badges/76e61b31-5ec3-48cb-8991-83d83954db8d/linked_in?t%253Ds2bfnq)) by [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/) and is based on the [Scrum Guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide?utm_source%253Dcredly%2526utm_medium%253DPSMI).

I have created some visualizations of the core principles of SCRUM, which you can download here. Feel free to use them for your personal use for whatever you want, as I publish them under the CC license.
